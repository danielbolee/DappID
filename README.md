# DappID

DappID is a web app that allows users to create unique AI generated avatars from their ENS name, and then mint those avatars as NFTs on the blockchain.

Users simply connect their Ethereum wallet, enter their ENS name (or use their connected wallet address), customize the art style, and generate and mint a one-of-a-kind identity-linked PFP NFT on the blockchain.

## Features

- Generate AI-powered profile pictures tailored to any ENS name or wallet address
- Customize the art style - anime, pixel art, landscapes, and more
- Seamlessly mint the finalized image as an ERC-721 NFT
- Built with React, Next.js, Thorin, Styled Components, Viem, Wagmi, Rainbowkit, Helia
